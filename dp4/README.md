Design Project 4: Lo-fi Prototyping
===================
----------
Team Name: **Drunken GUI** <br />
Team Members: **Sangyeob Lee, Sunmin Son, Hyungwoo Kim, Kyungyun Lee**

----------

### **POV:**
* **USER** - someone who frequently goes out to drink
* **USERâ€™S NEED** - tools to aid him remember what happened during drinking nights
* **INSIGHT** - the user often does not remember after drinking too much when he wants or needs to remember.

-----------
### **Tasks:**

* Start recording
* Recall what you did last night (during the drinking occasion)
* Find out where you were last night (according to location)

-----------
### **Prototype:**

* **Prototyping tool**: We used marvelapp.com for our digital prototyping because the other two did not have what we wanted such as sharing or directly making a UI with the prototyping program's User Interface. For example, proto.io did not have sharing ability so it was difficult to "share" and co-work. Invision did have sharing but it did not have user interface tool to directly create UI; the program required the user to draw and upload. 

*  **Design Choices** : 

*  **Representative Screenshots** : 
<img src="home.png" width="400"/>
<img src="record.png" width="400" />
<img src="calendar.png" width="400"/>
<img src="occasion.png" width="400"/>
<img src="path.png" width="400"/>

*  **Instructions** :
> our prototype is accessible through following link: https://marvelapp.com/43g90a1/screen/27327836 
> 
> When first opened press enable location access (it was made to pretend that we are using the location service to track the user).  The rest is self-explanatory. The user can start recording by pressing the record, there's a stop button when the user want to stop the recording. User can see the history (path and pictures) of drinking with view history.
