# Design Project: Human Computer Interaction Project

Design Project 1: Needfinding
===================
----------
Team: Drunken GUI
----------

**Experience:**
We are planning to redesign the experience of drinking

----------

**Observations & Interviews:**

_38 years old pub owner_



A narrative of the people you observed and interviewed. For each narrative, focus on interesting moments and breakdowns -- when the user is trying to do something but fails, takes long to do, or doesn't know how to do. Use at least one photo or sketch for each person to highlight the specific points.
Note: Each member should observe and interview at least one person. Next to each interviewee, write down members of your team who were there for the interview.
Note: Do not use real names of the users, but describe who they were in detail.

----------

**Needs:**
 
> - There are too many types of beer that even experts are unable to keep up with everything
> - People want to get information about where to get variety of drinks at a cheaper price (세계맥주 4+1 행사, 고급 와인 창고 세일) especially because more people are drinking alone at home.
> - People want to know what a certain drink tastes like before they buy it.
> - People sometimes have trouble finding people to drink with.
> - People want to know what happened the night before (흑역사).
> - collecting money from the people after drinking.
> - People want to know how much alcohol they drank (주량).
> - People want to check if there is enough space (or preferred spot) for the group.
> - People want to prove that they are not drunk.
> - Transparent ordering history.

**Insights**
> - People who know about drinks well, have their own “methods” for drinking.
> - Everyone has his or her preference when it comes to beer!
> - Age hits you hard.
> - People avoid sweeter alcohols because they are worried about high calories.
> - Conform to majority when ordering drinks/snacks.
> - Even people who know a lot about liquor know what they are ordering before actually ordering.
> - People who don’t drink feel left out when they don’t know how to make a certain combination of mixture.
> - Not everyone prefers cold beer.
> - People drink to give themselves a reward.
> - People who like to drink alone drink spontaneously more often 
> - People usually play drinking games when the number of people makes it difficult for everybody at the table to participate on the same conversation

Studio Reflections: Summarize the feedback from the studio session, and mention how you addressed it or will address it later in the process.
