###**Observations & Interviews:**


Interview 1 
 
 - Age/Sex : 38, Female
 - Occupation : Pub owner
 - Interviewer : Kyung Yun Lee, Hyungwoo Kim

>Jiyeon and her husband owns a well-known pub that specializes in beer. Their most popular items are craft beers that they make. The pub attracts all types of people, ranging from university students, who want to find a good quality beer to foreigners in the area. Many people actually are long time regular customers, who seek for unique and high quality drinks. When interviewing Jiyeon, she was quite humble, despite the fact that she owns a bar and probably has way more knowledge about drinks than average drinkers. Unlike other interviewees, there were some interesting comments that were due to her deeper understanding of drinks. She has a specific preference in the types of beers: sour ale, IPA and not too cold beer. When going out for a drink, she will definitely explore new beers, but she knows what she is ordering. Therefore, if she is with her friends, they will order different drinks, and actually line them up to create a order in which one to drink first. Although it felt like she knew a lot about beers, both her and her husband mentioned that they will never know a lot about beers, because there are way too many variety of beers and that crafting beer is a very delicate and sensitive process. They say even getting the right flatness of a beer is a very difficult process and that most people cannot distinguish a flat beer from a non-flat one. Additionally, Jiyeon mentioned that she rarely gets sweet drinks and that the reason is calories. As she got older, she does not drink more than 2 drinks a night, and because she is now more aware of the hangovers, she refrains from overdrinking. She drinks 3~4 times a week, and drinking is normally not planned, because the most frequent motivation to drink is self reward and then, the special occasions, like seeing friends in a long time, follow. When asked about exploring different bars and the important factors that are considered when choosing a place to drink, she said she does not normally have time to do such things, since she runs her bar at night. But she always keeps an eye on places she want to go, when she have a free night.

###**Needs:**
- There are too many types of beer that even experts are unable to keep up with everything
- People want to get information about where to get variety of drinks at a cheaper price (세계맥주 4+1 행사, 고급 와인 창고 세일) especially because more people are drinking alone at home.
- People want to know what a certain drink tastes like before they buy it.
- People sometimes have trouble finding people to drink with.
- People want to know what happened the night before (흑역사).
- collecting money from the people after drinking.
- People want to know how much alcohol they drank (주량).
- People want to check if there is enough space (or preferred spot) for the group.
- People want to prove that they are not drunk.
- Transparent ordering history.

-----------
###**Insights**
- People who know about drinks well, have their own “methods” for drinking.
- Everyone has his or her preference when it comes to beer!
- Age hits you hard.
- People avoid sweeter alcohols because they are worried about high calories.
- Conform to majority when ordering drinks/snacks.
- Even people who know a lot about liquor know what they are ordering before actually ordering.
- People who don’t drink feel left out when they don’t know how to make a certain combination of mixture.
- Not everyone prefers cold beer.
- People drink to give themselves a reward.
- People who like to drink alone drink spontaneously more often 
- People usually play drinking games when the number of people makes it difficult for everybody at the table to participate on the same conversation

###**Studio Reflections:** 

 **Feedback Summary**: 
 
 People liked our idea of redesigning the experience connected to drinking. It's very relevant to Korean culture; therefore, producing a solution seems useful. However, there seems to be a lack of focus in trying to find the problem with drinking Graphic User Interface. Also redesigning means that there is a previous design that needs to be worked on, so our group should have an inconvenient UI that needs to be improved upon. But our group doesn't have that yet. In other words, we need to pinpoint the problem.

**Course of Action**: 

In "Needfinding" part of the design project, we focused mainly on observing and empathizing with the potential target users in the domain of (alcohol) drinking activity. Through series of interviews, our group has gathered existing needs from the non drinkers to drinkers. In the upcoming weeks, we will define the problem by eliminating needs that cannot be satisfied with web application
