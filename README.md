**Observations & Interviews:**

_38 years old pub owner_



A narrative of the people you observed and interviewed. For each narrative, focus on interesting moments and breakdowns -- when the user is trying to do something but fails, takes long to do, or doesn't know how to do. Use at least one photo or sketch for each person to highlight the specific points.
Note: Each member should observe and interview at least one person. Next to each interviewee, write down members of your team who were there for the interview.
Note: Do not use real names of the users, but describe who they were in detail.

### Interview 1

>
> - Name : Jiyeon Baek
> - Age/Sex : 38, Female
> - Occupation : Pub owner
> - Interviewer : Kyung Yun Lee, Hyungwoo Kim


> Jiyeon and her husband owns a well-known pub that specializes in beer. Their most popular items are craft beers that they make. The pub attracts all types of people, ranging from university students, who want to find a good quality beer to foreigners in the area. Many people actually are long time regular customers, who seek for unique and high quality drinks. When interviewing Jiyeon, she was quite humble, despite the fact that she owns a bar and probably has way more knowledge about drinks than average drinkers. Unlike other interviewees, there were some interesting comments that were due to her deeper understanding of drinks. She has a specific preference in the types of beers: sour ale, IPA and not too cold beer. When going out for a drink, she will definitely explore new beers, but she knows what she is ordering. Therefore, if she is with her friends, they will order different drinks, and actually line them up to create a order in which one to drink first. Although it felt like she knew a lot about beers, both her and her husband mentioned that they will never know a lot about beers, because there are way too many variety of beers and that crafting beer is a very delicate and sensitive process. They say even getting the right flatness of a beer is a very difficult process and that most people cannot distinguish a flat beer from a non-flat one. Additionally, Jiyeon mentioned that she rarely gets sweet drinks and that the reason is calories. As she got older, she does not drink more than 2 drinks a night, and because she is now more aware of the hangovers, she refrains from overdrinking. She drinks 3~4 times a week, and drinking is normally not planned, because the most frequent motivation to drink is self reward and then, the special occasions, like seeing friends in a long time, follow. When asked about exploring different bars and the important factors that are considered when choosing a place to drink, she said she does not normally have time to do such things, since she runs her bar at night. But she always keeps an eye on places she want to go, when she have a free night.
