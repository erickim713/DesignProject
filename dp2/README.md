**Top 3 HMW:**
> **how might we make the experience of taking care of the drunk less arduous or more rewarding?** <br /><br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the night, the sober usually takes care of the drunk. Since they are voluntarily doing this, we thought they would be happier if they were rewarded for their efforts.

> **how might we allow the users to get alcohol at a cheaper price?** <br /><br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People going out to drink face this problem often times; since alcohols are not free, going out to drink can be financially burdensome. 

> **how might we inform users about what happened the night before?** <br /><br />
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People often become curious about what happened the night before when they see mysterious bruises or empty wallets. Perhaps they can solve this curiosity without bothering the person who took care of them.

## Storyboard 1 : "DrunkenGo"

A parody to PokemonGo, DrukenGo is a fun drunken friend saving service. It involves at least 2 people, one who plans to get drunk and one who will escort the drunk. First, the user creates a post that says he will get drunk today, so he wishes to get saved by someone with a reward of tomorrow's dinner. Then, a friend of him, who planned to study till 4am,  sees this post on SNS and thinks he can do it for a free dinner tomorrow. So, he reacts to the post and gets back to studying. At around 4am, he goes on a search for his friend. On the side of the street, he finds his friend drunk! He safely escorts the drunken friend to his home.

## Storyboard 2 : "Spread the Word"

More and more people drink at home, as the price of drinks have increased, especially when drinking at a bar. Therefore, many people are interested in discounts and sales of drinks, like 4+1 pick-whatever-you-want beer sale. However, it is not easy to know where and what sales are happening around your area or online. If the users can spread the word and receive some benefit as a consequence, then it benefits both the users and the business. First, there is a user, who frequently visits the website that lists out all the drink sales in the area. He finds out that there is a huge beer sale this weekend at E-mart. He knows that his friends will be very interested, so he sends messages to them about the sale. After sending 5 messages, he gets a coupon for a free bottle of beer at next purchase.

## Storyboard 3 : "Drunken Path"

The morning after drinking, we often find ourselves unable to remember what had happened last night. Perhaps one might have done something very unexpected and is curious about last night's happenings. One can ask friends, who went out together, but it may lack details. So, the user uses the "Drunken path tracker". He will simply start recording, when he is going out to drink. Then the service will begin to keep track of GPS, bank transactions, messages and call histories. The tracking will stop either when the user stops it or at 7am. As usual, the user over drank and wakes up the next day with no memories. But he has his drunken path recorded! He checks his path and is shocked at 150,000won spent at a chicken bar.
