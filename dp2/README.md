**Top 3 HMW:**
>**how might we make the experience of taking care of the drunk less arduous or more rewarding?**
>>At the end of the night, the sober usually takes care of the drunk. Since they are voluntarily doing this, we thought they would be happier if they were rewarded for their efforts.
<br />
>**how might we allow the users to get alcohol at a cheaper price?**
>> People going out to drink face this problem often times; since alcohols are not free, going out to drink can be financially burdensome. 
<br />
>**how might we inform users about what happened the night before?**
>>People often become curious about what happened the night before when they see mysterious bruises or empty wallets. Perhaps they can solve this curiosity without bothering the person who took care of them.
