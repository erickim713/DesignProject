Design Project 7: User Testing
===================
----------
Team Name: **Drunken GUI** <br />
Team Members: **Sangyeob Lee, Sunmin Son, Hyungwoo Kim, Kyungyun Lee**

### **Written Protocol:**
* instructions for preparation and setting up the testing environment:
	* this is a fixed experiment, meaning that the user interface will only be tested and the real data of tracking the person will be created by the web application makers.
	* Since our objective is if our user interface is intuitive and learnable, we believed that making the tester remember what this other person did last night can still prove the effectiveness of our user interface.
	* The users will be given a link to open https://cdn.rawgit.com/erickim713/DesignProject/fc422796/prototype/index.html this is the link to the entry of our app.
	* The user will spin 30 times to be in the same state as the drunk person in the morning (dizzy).
	* When user starts using the application two people will observe, one person will be ready to assist the user if user can't move on without help (hopefully doesn't happen). The last person will be the tech guy who will come into play if there is an error with the web application during the tests.

* introduction and informed consent:
	> Thank you for participating in our user study.
	We found that people who go out to drink often find their wallets empty, glasses broken or missing, call histories that are unexplainable. Our Drunken Path web application aims to help users who often go out to drink recollect their memories about what they did last night. We hope that you are able to have a fun and helpful experience while recalling your memories from your drunk nights through our web application.
We need your personal information to analyze our project’s results for future improvements. We will collect your age, gender, occupation data. Do you agree?

* tutorial or training (if needed):
	* to test our app's intuitiveness, affordance, and learnability we have no tutorial or training.

* task list & instruction:
	* Recording
		* Begin the recording (test start recording)
		* End the recording (test end recording)
	* Find out what you did on previous nights
		* How much are you supposed to collect from your friends on May 2nd?
		* Who were you with on May 5th?
	* Find out where you were on previous nights
		* Where were you at 11:50pm on May 5th?
		* At what time did you arrive at your home on April 27th?

* recording strategy:
	* We will have screen recording so that we can capture the user behavior during the user testing.
	* 2 of the members will record the user behavior and feedback during the user testing (user’s tend to speak out loud if they are looking for something)
	* 1 of the member will standby so that if users have trouble using the application for the sake of other task testing, the standby person will help.
	* Lastly, tech person will wait if there’s any malfunction during testing so that everyone’s aware of what’s going on if there’s a bug

* questionanaires, interview questions:
	* Were you able to find out ...
		* What you wanted to find? (or was told to find?)
		* Amount of money you need to collect?
		* Who you were with?
		* Who you talked or hung out with?
		* Where you were?
		* Where you lost your stuff?
		* Were you able to use the application smoothly?
		* Was the navigation easy to do?
			* If not, what was difficult or not intuitive?

* debrief prompt:
	> Thank you for taking part in our project.

	> We are trying to aid people who drink a lot that tend to fail remembering their memories from last night. So what we have done is track the person's movement and have user's activity be recorded.  



### **Session Observations:**

### User Testing 1 ###
Participant: 24 years old male
Recruit Method: Asked if he had time to try out our application.
Why This person?: He doesn't drink too often but when he drinks a lot he tends to lose his stuff and forget where he left his belongings.

Summary of the Session: the user stated that the app was really useful because he can clearly see where he was last night. Just by doing that, he said, the possible locations of the lost belongings are limited. In addition he said the navigation and usage of the app was very intuitive. He first stated that calendar was not intuitive enough because of the unfinished implementation. He also stated that history page was not intuitve. The information that it provides is really valuable and easy to use when the user is used to it but when encountering first time, he said he didn't know what to do.
