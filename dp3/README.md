### **Photos of your prototype:**

<img src="main.jpeg" />

> Main menu

<img src="recording.jpeg" />

> Recording screen. Users can reach here by click/tapping on the start recording button on the main menu.

<img src="calendar.jpeg" />

> When clicking/tapping view history button on the main menu, this calendar will show up. The soju bottles represent days you recorded.

> After selecting a date in the calendar, photos of the day will be displayed

<img src="path_map.jpeg" />

> And by tapping on the path tab on the top, the user can see where he/she was and what he/she did on the day. The list of activity, time, and marker on the map are scrollable and once the user moves one of it, the others will move along.

> When zooming the map, the user will be able to see the map in street view

### **Briefing:**

>Hello, we are team DrunkenGUI from Human-Computer Interaction class. We wanted to redesign the drinking experience for people who frequently go out to drink. After interviewing some people, we found that many drinkers are curious about what happened night before because itâ€™s difficult to remember things when you were drunk. So we wanted to provide a service to resolve this problem.

>In our application, we make it easy for the user to start recording their night and to check out what they did when they wake up the next morning (hopefully). Since people are interested in where they were and what they did or said the night before, we provided a user interface and functions to do just that in our application.

*summary: we showed the participants the same two paragraphs we wrote above. It explains what we are trying to do and briefly hint what user can expect from our prototype*

### **Individual Reflections**

HyungWoo Kim: In each round of the paper prototype testing, I was the computer guy; I would do the task the application would have done if it was actual product when used by the target users. While carrying out my role, the hardest part was trying to hold back from telling the user that he or she should do certain task or that he or she can't do such task on this application. Through our paper prototyping, we were able to find both the major and subtle faults in our application, such as not being clear on what the user can do at certain pages(calendar page) of the application. In addition I was happy to find out that a lot of users would use our application if it was an actual product. In paper prototyping, we were able to find out if the tasks are able to be done by the users. However, we weren't able to find out if these tasks were actually implementable as well as how it would do in real context without having the facilitator involved in the testing session.
