Design Project 8: Iteration & Wrap-up(FINALLY OMFG)
===================
----------
Team Name: **Drunken GUI** <br />
Team Members: **Sangyeob Lee, Sunmin Son, Hyungwoo Kim, Kyungyun Lee**

----------

### **Iteration:**
* What did we do?
	- Fix problems that arose from the first user testing.
	- Refine the user testing instruction 
	- Second round of user testing
* Why?
	- Since our goal is to make the mobile web application most effective by adapting to the user's need and intuition it's necessary for us to fix the problems that were found during the user testing.
	- We also refined the user testing instructions so that it's less confusing for user to understand what they are supposed to do during the user testing
	- We also did second round of user testing to make sure that we improved from the previous version.
* What changes did we make?
	- Pop up to give good feedback to the user, make a "instruction" feature so that users can get a clue of what they can do with the application, calendar fix so that it works, main page changes so that user's not encountered with too much information.
* Concrete examples:
	- (Screenshots later)
* What did you learn?:
	- We learned from the user testings that effective and user-satisfying applications can be made; however, there's always room for more user testing that can improve the usability (learnability, efficiency, safety) of the application.
	- Also we learned that instruction page is actually really helpful. As a developer we thought that instruction page was an extra feature that would be just taking up spot and reduce the simplicity of the application. However, for users who are wondering what applications can do, it was very valuable.
